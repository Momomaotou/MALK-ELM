# code
  MFKL. py is the running file of our proposed algorithm.  
  The NSL-KDD dataset is the default dataset.  
  If you want to change the dataset, you need to manually adjust the size of the last Dense layer of the model to match the number of labels in the dataset.  
  Select the dataset for feature grouping through the FeatureGroup.py. Then write the grouping results into the FeatureRead.py.
